# UBER Data analysis

The data is increasing day by day and approx 2.5 quintillion bytes of data generate every day. 
Now, from this data analysis and get useful information which is most important and to understand that here we perform data analysis on UBER data using Python.
We do process of cleaning, transforming, manipulating data into useful information, so we can use that in future decision-making.
Basically we take one data set of UBER trips and then do analysis.
Analysis will do by making of Tables & Charts, so itâ€™s easily understandable for anyone.
